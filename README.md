# HireSmart Backend - Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for setting up the HireSmart backend on a local development machine using Laravel Sail.

---

### **1. Prerequisites**

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- **Docker Desktop:** Laravel Sail uses Docker to create a consistent development environment. [Download and install it here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
- **Git:** For cloning the project repository.

*You do not need to install PHP, Composer, or Node.js locally. All required versions are provided by the Sail development environment.*

---

### **2. Installation Steps**

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
Open your terminal and clone the project repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/returntruejoy/hiresmart
Or with ssh
git clone git@github.com:returntruejoy/hiresmart.git
cd hiresmart
```

**Step 2: Copy the Environment File**
This file stores your application's configuration, including database credentials and API keys.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**Step 3: Start the Sail Containers**
This command will download the necessary Docker images and start all the services (app, PostgreSQL database, Redis) in the background.

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up -d
```
*Note: The first time you run this, it may take several minutes to download the required Docker images.*

**Step 4: Install Composer Dependencies**
Once the containers are running, execute this command to install the project's PHP dependencies inside the application container.

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail composer install
```

**Step 5: Generate Application & JWT Keys**
Every Laravel application needs a unique key for encryption, and our app needs a key for JWT authentication.

```bash
# Generate Laravel App Key
./vendor/bin/sail artisan key:generate

# Generate JWT Secret Key
./vendor/bin/sail artisan jwt:secret
```

**Step 6: Run Migrations and Seed the Database**
This single command creates all the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database and populates them with essential data, including a default admin user and test data for jobs and candidates.

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

**üéâ Congratulations, the installation is complete!**

---

### **3. Running and Testing the Application**

**Your application is already running.** The API is accessible at `http://localhost`
Do not forget to use /api/v1/ before every endpoints.

**Step 1: Run the Queue Worker (Crucial)**
Our most important features (like job matching and notifications) run as background jobs. You **must** have a queue worker running to process them.

**Open a new, separate terminal window**, navigate to the project directory, and run:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail artisan queue:work
```
*Leave this terminal open. It acts as your background job processor.*

**Step 2: Test the Public API**
In your original terminal, you can test if the API is responding correctly by fetching the public job listings or Leverage the Postman collection.

```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost/api/v1/job-posts" -H "Accept: application/json" | jq

Or you can use  postman*
```
*This should return a JSON array of the sample job posts created by the seeder.*

**Step 3: Default Admin User**
The database seeder creates a default admin user for you to use.

- **Email:** `admin@hiresmart.com`
- **Password:** `password`

You can use these credentials with an API client (like Postman or Insomnia) to log in via the `/api/v1/login` endpoint and test authenticated routes.

# Manually trigger the job matching process
./vendor/bin/sail artisan app:run-job-matching-now

# Manually archive job posts older than 30 days
./vendor/bin/sail artisan jobs:archive-old

# Manually remove unverified users older than 7 days
./vendor/bin/sail artisan app:remove-unverified-users

# Run the scheduler to execute daily/weekly tasks (for testing)
./vendor/bin/sail artisan schedule:run

# HireSmart Backend - Complete Project Overview & Testing Guide

## üéØ Executive Summary

**HireSmart** is a sophisticated job platform backend built with Laravel 12, featuring intelligent job matching, automated notifications, and performance optimization. The system connects employers with qualified candidates through an AI-powered matching algorithm that considers skills, salary expectations, and location preferences.

---

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Laravel 12 (PHP 8.2+)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Queue System**: Redis-based background job processing
- **Email**: Laravel Mail with queued notifications
- **Development Environment**: Docker (Laravel Sail)

### Architectural Pattern
The system follows a **Service/Repository Pattern** for clean, maintainable code:
- **Repositories**: Handle all database interactions (UserRepository, JobPostRepository, ApplicationRepository)
- **Services**: Contain business logic (AuthService, JobMatchingService, JobPostService, etc.)
- **Controllers**: Thin layer handling HTTP requests/responses
- **Policies**: Authorization logic for resource access control

---

## üë• User Roles & Authentication

### User Types
1. **Admin** (`admin`): System administration and oversight
2. **Employer** (`employer`): Post jobs, manage applications, view statistics
3. **Candidate** (`candidate`): Apply to jobs, receive match notifications

### Authentication System
- **JWT-based authentication** for secure, stateless API access
- **Role-based authorization** using middleware and policies
- **Secure registration** prevents public admin user creation
- **Default admin account**: `admin@hiresmart.com` / `password`

### Security Features
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token expiration and refresh
- Role-based route protection
- Policy-based resource authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
